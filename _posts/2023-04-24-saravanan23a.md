title: Exploring Social Bias in Downstream Applications of Text-to-Image Foundation
  Models
abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have been adopted into key commercial workflows,
  such as art generation and image editing. Characterizing the implicit social biases
  they exhibit, such as gender and racial stereotypes, is a necessary first step in
  avoiding discriminatory outcomes. While existing studies on social bias focus on
  image generation, the biases exhibited in alternate applications of diffusion-based
  foundation models remain under-explored. We propose a framework that uses synthetic
  images to probe two applications of diffusion models, image editing and classification,
  for social bias. Using our framework, we uncover meaningful and significant inter-sectional
  social biases in Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art open-source text-to-image
  model. Our findings caution against the uninformed adoption of text-to-image foundation
  models for downstream tasks and services.
